## :crossed_swords: Game combat battle engine :bow_and_arrow:

### Intent of the project:

  The intent of this project is to create a code base that can be used as a combat engine for a game, and allow the user to run combat simulations, watch step-by-step or just hit go and see what happens.

### Beginner friendly!

The most important objective of this project is to be friendly and accessable to **beginning programmers and game players**.  When a new programmer starts looking at a large code base, it can be overwhealming and often difficult to find a way to break everything down and understand the structure.  The project also has to be beginner friendly, since making game engines is new to me.
  
This project will maintain a folder full of *mini* engine components, that are examples, and also proof of concept for features that are added.  Compontents will be identified by a *level* so that anybody wishing to learn, can start with lower level components and work their way up!  They can also make their own versions of the component and contribute them to the project and strengthen the library.  As an example, a lvl 1 component might be a simple first year computer science level program that battles two monsters with health, armour and damage values... a higher level component might be an example program that introduces combat over the network.  To help keep the environment friendly, components will serve as documentation for each feature of the project and stepping stones to gain experience.
    
### What are we really making?

While the possibilities are endless, and ideas are all welcome...  The goal is to start simple, 1v1 and grow from there.  Ideas to get started, some easy some very advanced, if only to inspire.

- Observe battle play-by-play or realtime.
- Option to load a character from a **character sheet** :scroll:
- Option to define character gear and effects
- Item and character generation for large battle simulations
- Option to define and load game mechanics for different game engines (examle json or xml file)
- Game board or battle areas defined as 1D line or 2D grid/map
- Visual representation of battle area, 2D side view, 2D top down, or even 3D graphics
- Character movement, including path finding algorithms and obsticle avoidance
- Option define character movement tatics, for individual characters and groups
- Option to pit characters from multiple universes against each other
- Option to define character behavour based lore/backstory (AI) (natural language processing AI)
- Run battle simulations with friends across common chat platforms or social media (networking / cloud)

### Technology:
Any languages and technology that are freely available to the community is welcome to be used, as long as the licensing allows for it, and everybody is able to obtain freely.

### Project name:
The name will be "game combat battle engine" until somebody suggests a better name.

### Contribution guidelines:
The guidelines will evolove as the project grows.  To get started, mini components will simply be pull requests with a folder containing the code and documentation for the example.
  
### Inspiration: 

Being isolated during a global pandemic has presented the opportunity to work on a project that has been a desire of mine for as long as I've worked with computers... a game engine!

I've always been facinated with how games make complex calculations in an instant that determine who will win a fight. One night some time ago, I was supposed to be doing my computer science homework, but instead I was playing Diablo2 and imagining the interactions between the characters and how it all works. My friend had been explaining to me that **"games like Diablo2 worke like D&D"**, with dice rolls, life, armour, buffs, equipment etc..  I didn't have much understanding of D&D at the time but I was able to follow the analogy...
  
Fast forward to the creation time of this project... I've been playing a beginner friendly, D&D campaigne that a teammate has been hosting during lunch hour.  Enjoyable and fun, I started thinking about the D&D engine and how the combat works compared to my thoughts of years past.  Because of a global pandemic at the time of writing this, the D&D campaigne has been put on hold, and I purchased a copy of Diablo3 to have some entertainment during the isolation. Let's just say with D3 added to the situation, and a lot more free time... the roll for initiative was high!
